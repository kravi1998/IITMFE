 <h1>Blockchain</h1>
 <hr>
 <p>
    <i>A blockchain is a distributed ledger</i> with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a <b>cryptographic</b> hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the <br>previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional <mark>block linking to the ones before it</mark>. Consequently, <strong> transactions</strong> are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively <em>without altering all subsequent blocks.</em>
